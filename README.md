C++ Inheritance Tests
=====================

This is a collection of sample code which will construct classes with various inheritance models. It is intended to be used to test RTTI and class detection/reconstruction in reverse-engineering frameworks such as retdec and ghidra. This is what is being used to generate the program data for the test classes in the [Ghidra-Cpp-Class-Analyzer](https://github.com/astrelsky/Ghidra-Cpp-Class-Analyzer).

A set of binaries compiled with various different architectures is available in the releases.
